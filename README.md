# TextRender

* Standalone library with optional dependencies.
* Draws beautiful images and text to the screen.
* Features background color, text outline, and drop shadow.
* Renders to the screen, desktop, or behind desktop icons as a wallpaper.
* Supports events such as OnEvent("LeftMouseDown", callback).
* Extremely fast and lightweight, capable of rendering at 300+ fps. 

### For extra ImageRender() functionality add ImagePut.ahk

Include [ImagePut](https://github.com/iseahound/ImagePut) to decode over 12+ image types including files, urls, streams, windows and more!

    #include TextRender.ahk
    #include ImagePut.ahk
    ir := ImageRender("https://picsum.photos/300/200")

Most users will not need to decode pointers and handles and can safely omit ImagePut.ahk
